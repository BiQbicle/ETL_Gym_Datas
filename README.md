Backend Calculations to Return:


- Descriptive Stats – Mean, median, std dev, min/max for all numeric fields

- By Gender – Compare key metrics (Calories_Burned, Avg_BPM, BMI, Session_Duration)

- By Workout_Type – Average calories, duration, intensity (Max_BPM) for each type

- By Experience_Level – Progression metrics (calories, frequency, performance)

- Age Groups – Member distribution across 5-10 year bands

That's your backend payload. Each one maps to a different chart type (histograms, bar charts, scatter plots, line graphs).

pages in sveltekit frontend also endpoints on the api side
learning out come :
- web app basics
- apis
- clean architecture
- doing frontned - html/css/jjs
- charts n shii
- doing ETL stuff - aka basic data engineering (fancy way of saying taking dataset to do calculation and structure in a way it's more valuable)
